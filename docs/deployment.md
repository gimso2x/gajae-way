# Deployment

## Production unit

Production runs the compiled standalone binaries. Build them on a machine with Bun:

```sh
bun run build
```

The result is:

```text
dist/gajaeway-gateway
dist/gajaeway-discord
dist/gajaeway-telegram
dist/gajaeway-slack
dist/gajaeway-admin
dist/gajaeway
```

Each binary requires its verb: `gajaeway-gateway daemon`, `gajaeway-admin serve`, and a subcommand for `gajaeway`. Invoked with no arguments they print usage on stderr and exit 2, so probing one never blocks. `gajaeway-discord`, `gajaeway-telegram`, and `gajaeway-slack` run in the foreground with no arguments; `gajaeway-discord --help` / `gajaeway-slack --help` and `--version` answer without connecting, and a second `gajaeway-discord` (or `gajaeway-slack`) refuses to boot while `$GAJAEWAY_HOME/adapter-discord.pid` (`adapter-slack.pid`) names a live process.

A production host does not need a source checkout, `node_modules`, or Bun to run those binaries. It does need the same global-user `gjc` executable and canonical agent directory/broker used by the operator's interactive SDK. Verify `command -v gjc` in that user's normal shell and set the service's `GJC_EXECUTABLE` explicitly to the verified absolute executable path. Run the service as that same user with the same canonical profile environment (`HOME`, and any intentional `GJC_CONFIG_DIR`/`PI_CONFIG_DIR` or `GJC_CODING_AGENT_DIR`/`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` selection). Do not introduce gateway-private overrides, copy model/provider configuration, or seed settings. The default profile is `~/.gjc/agent`; using the same executable with a different agent directory is not the same runtime. GJC owns its daemon; the gateway is an SDK client only. Credentials belong in the user's established protected environment, not in copied broker settings.

## Home and configuration

`GAJAEWAY_HOME` selects the state directory; it defaults to `~/.gajaeway`. The gateway makes the home directory private (`0700`). A typical layout is:

```text
$GAJAEWAY_HOME/
  config.json
  adapter-discord.json
  adapter-telegram.json
  adapter-slack.json
  adapter-discord.pid        # single-instance lock, held by the running Discord adapter
  adapter-slack.pid          # same, for the Slack adapter
  adapters/slack/recovery-cursor.json  # Slack missed-message watermarks
  gateway.sock
  gateway.db
  workspace/                 # SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, USER.md; gjc working directory
  memory/                    # Markdown files and private Git repository
  memory-receipts.jsonl
  secrets/
    discord-token
    telegram-token
    slack-bot-token          # xoxb-…
    slack-app-token          # xapp-… (Socket Mode)
```

Use `config.json` schema version 1. Every configured secret is a credential-file reference; a credential file may be referenced by only one configured credential.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "logVerbosity": "info",
  "socketPath": "/Users/me/gajaeway/gateway.sock",
  "dbPath": "/Users/me/gajaeway/gateway.db",
  "credentials": {
    "discord": { "credentialFile": "/Users/me/gajaeway/secrets/discord-token" },
    "telegram": { "credentialFile": "/Users/me/gajaeway/secrets/telegram-token" }
  },
  "channels": {
    "discord-channel-id": { "engagement": "open", "audience": "human-only" },
    "slack:C0123456789": { "engagement": "mention-open" }
  },
  "webhook": { "bind": "127.0.0.1", "port": 8080, "exposeNonLoopback": false },
  "watcherRoots": ["/Users/me/automations"],
  "scriptRoot": "/Users/me/automations",
  "stallTimeoutMs": 120000
}
```

`socketPath`, `dbPath`, `logVerbosity`, credentials, channels, webhook, watcher roots, script root, and `stallTimeoutMs` are optional. Socket and database paths default inside the home directory, `stallTimeoutMs` defaults to 120000 ms, and log verbosity defaults to `info`. `turnTimeoutMs` is rejected because persistent-session liveness is alert-only; `settleWindowMs`, `channels.*.settleWindowMs` and `maxInboundAgeMs` are rejected because every message is steered or sent immediately and nothing expires while queued.

## Slack adapter

`gajaeway-slack` connects over **Socket Mode**, so the host needs no public URL and no inbound firewall rule. It reads `$GAJAEWAY_HOME/adapter-slack.json`:

```json
{
  "botTokenFile": "secrets/slack-bot-token",
  "appTokenFile": "secrets/slack-app-token",
  "gatewaySocket": "/Users/me/gajaeway/gateway.sock",
  "channels": { "C0123456789": { "engagement": "open" } }
}
```

Both token files are credential-file references (relative paths resolve against the config directory) and are validated by prefix: the bot token must start with `xoxb-`, the app-level token with `xapp-`. A wrong prefix is a startup error naming the file, never the value. `gatewaySocket` defaults to `$GAJAEWAY_HOME/gateway.sock`. The adapter's own `channels` map only promotes an `open` channel's messages to a mention before they reach the gateway; the gateway's `config.json` `channels` map, keyed `slack:<channelId>`, remains the authority for mode and audience.

Create the Slack app from a manifest with:

- Socket Mode **enabled**, and an app-level token with the `connections:write` scope (`appTokenFile`).
- Bot token scopes: `app_mentions:read channels:history channels:read chat:write groups:history groups:read im:history im:read im:write mpim:history mpim:read reactions:read reactions:write users:read files:read commands`.
- Event subscriptions (bot events): `message.channels message.groups message.im message.mpim reaction_added reaction_removed`.
- Slash commands `/new`, `/reset`, and `/restart` (any request URL; Socket Mode delivers them over the socket).

Invite the bot to every channel it should read; Slack delivers no history or events for channels the bot is not a member of.

Origins are `slack/dm/D…/peer=U…` for direct messages, `slack/channel/C…` for public, private, and multi-person channels, and `slack/thread/C…:<thread_ts>/parent=C…` for messages inside a thread. Platform message ids are `channel:ts` pairs because a Slack `ts` is unique only within its channel. Replies default into threads: a channel mention is answered in a thread rooted at the message that triggered it (the room stays readable and the conversation continues in that thread, which is its own session), a reply inside a thread stays in it, and a DM sent inside a thread is answered in that thread. `[REPLY:<channel:ts>]` overrides the target.

Presence is a reaction gradient on the message the persona is answering, not a posted or edited message: on acceptance the message gets ⏳; as the turn moves it becomes 🔧 (running a tool), 💭 (reading a result), ✍️ (writing); a clock face 🕐…🕛 advances once per minute and a digit 1️⃣ 2️⃣ 3️⃣ 5️⃣ 🔟 💯 tracks tool calls (or tokens when the runtime reports none). Each marker is swapped only when its bucket changes and at most once per 15 seconds, and every marker comes off when the reply lands. The tool's name and stated intent are never rendered in chat; they are shown in the admin console's live-work row. Outbound writes are paced per channel (about one per second; replies take priority over status edits), HTTP 429 is retried up to three times honouring `Retry-After` and then left as an ambiguous delivery for the next redelivery pass rather than recorded as a failure, and a reconnect after a blip shorter than five seconds does not repeat a catch-up pass that finished within the last minute. Reactions are mapped by Slack emoji name (`👍` → `+1`, `🦞` → `lobster`); the whole allowlist is deliverable, and the presence markers are disjoint from it so the two never collide. Inbound text is normalised (`<@U…>` mentions, `<#C…|name>`, links, `&amp;`) before it reaches the persona, and outbound Markdown is converted to Slack mrkdwn. Files and images arrive as `[image · name · size · url]` lines; the persona needs the bot token to fetch `url_private`. There is no voice transcription or spoken reply on Slack.

After every socket connect and gateway reconnect the adapter backfills missed messages from `conversations.history`, keyed by `channel:ts`, so the gateway's durable dedupe makes overlap with live traffic safe. Coverage is bounded on purpose: only channels listed in `adapter-slack.json` `channels`, the 100 most recently active DMs seen live within 30 days, and threads the persona replied in during the last 7 days are revisited; a channel with no watermark is backfilled 24 hours deep, and an oversized gap drains across passes in bounded slices. Channels the bot cannot read are quarantined after three consecutive failures and probed again on the next connect. A message the gateway refuses three times for its own content is dead-lettered into `adapters/slack/recovery-cursor.json` (with a per-channel digest) rather than pinning the channel; a gateway outage never discards anything.

## Reloading configuration without a restart

A running gateway re-reads `config.json` on `SIGHUP` (`kill -HUP <pid>`) or on the `gateway.reloadConfig` verb; both run the same implementation, so the console and the signal behave identically.

The reload is fail-safe and reports exactly what it did:

- `changed` — fields applied live: `mentionAllowlist`, `channels`, `stallTimeoutMs`, and `dmPolicy`. Verify the next event through the path consuming the changed policy.
- `restartRequired` — fields bound to startup resources: `socketPath`, `dbPath`, `model`, `serviceTier`, `credentials`, `webhook`, `watcherRoots`, `scriptRoot`, `runtime`, `ownerTarget`, `monitorContextFailureRollThreshold`, and `work`. They are reported and deliberately NOT applied; restart to pick them up.
- `ignored` — fields you edited that no code reads at all. `logVerbosity` is currently parsed but unconsumed, so editing it has no effect and no restart would give it one.
- On a parse or validation error, or when `config.json` is missing or unreadable, the reload fails, keeps the previous configuration untouched, and returns a diagnostic. A missing file never publishes defaults over live policy, because that would drop the mention allowlist and open a mention-gated room.

Every reload is logged with the trigger and all three field lists.

The Discord adapter has a separate `$GAJAEWAY_HOME/adapter-discord.json` because it reads its own token:

```json
{
  "tokenFile": "/Users/me/gajaeway/secrets/discord-token",
  "gatewaySocket": "/Users/me/gajaeway/gateway.sock",
  "channels": { "discord-channel-id": { "engagement": "open", "audience": "human-only" } }
}
```

`engagement` selects how messages become turns: `open` admits them without addressing, `mention-open` requires a real mention or native reply to this bot, and `closed` requires both addressing and owner/allowlist authorization. In `mention-open` and `closed`, a bot author is addressed only by an explicit mention in its text: a native reply to this bot and follow-up lines in a thread this bot is already answering address humans, not bots, so personas sharing a thread do not answer each other on every line. `audience` independently restricts authors to `all`, `human-only`, or `bot-only`; `closed` ignores it. Omitting `audience` keeps the safe `human-only` default (humans follow the mode; bots stay on the closed gate).

Bot-authored turns admitted by a widened audience are unlimited in sequence by default. Set `botAudience.maxConsecutiveTurns` globally, or `channels.<key>.botAudienceMaxConsecutiveTurns`, to require a human message after N consecutive bot turns. The runaway guard is the rolling-minute rate limit `botAudience.maxTurnsPerWindow` (per-channel override `botAudienceMaxTurnsPerWindow`), default 30 bot admissions per conversation per minute; it is not reset by a human message. Both declines are logged with the origin's current counts and counted in `gateway.status` (`engagement.botAudienceDeclines`, `engagement.botAudienceRateLimited`).

On startup and gateway reconnect, the adapter backfills each configured Discord channel, its active threads, and recent archived threads whose last activity is within 30 days. DMs cannot be enumerated through Discord, so live DM ingress records a bounded recovery set before `chat.send`; the adapter retains at most 100 DM conversations and expires entries after 30 days. Progress is stored atomically in `$GAJAEWAY_HOME/adapters/discord/recovery-cursor.json`. A missing-access or deleted conversation keeps its watermark and is retried twice, then quarantined on the third unreadable result so healthy conversations can finish; a later reconnect probes it and re-admits it when history is readable again. Message-id dedupe in the gateway makes live/recovery races and restart resumes exactly-once.

Keep token files out of version control and restrict their permissions. Replace a token file and restart the relevant service to rotate it.

## Service manager: launchd example

Install binaries and state outside macOS TCC-protected directories such as Desktop, Documents, and Downloads. A launchd process can hang when its working directory, `gjc`, or a symlink target lies there. Put the binaries, `gjc`, and `$GAJAEWAY_HOME` somewhere such as `~/gajaeway`.

A user agent can launch the gateway:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">

</dict></plist>
```

### The service owns its own log sink

Each daemon writes its own rotating sink under `$GAJAEWAY_HOME`: `gateway.log`, `adapter-discord.log`, `adapter-slack.log`. Every line begins with an ISO-8601 UTC timestamp and a level, identical consecutive events collapse into one `x<N> (identical, first=… last=…)` line, the live file rotates to `.1`…`.5` at 10 MB, and an hourly `service_alive uptime=…` line makes log silence distinguishable from service silence.

The service manager's own stdout/stderr redirect must therefore NOT point at those paths - it would double-write every line. Point it at a separate file (as above) or leave it to the journal; the owned sink is the one to read during an incident.

This launchd example is macOS-specific, not a deployment command for the systemd host reached on SSH port 24. Before installing it, set its executable and profile paths to the verified interactive user's values. A launchd job does not inherit your shell: supply the same canonical profile environment and required model-key variables through a protected mechanism. An already-running shared GJC daemon retains its own environment; restarting the gateway does not rotate that daemon's credentials. Protect the plist:

```sh
chmod 600 ~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.gajaeway.gateway.plist
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.gajaeway.gateway.plist
```

Run the Discord, Telegram, and Slack binaries as separate managed services after the gateway. `gajaeway services install --bin-dir DIR` writes definitions for the gateway, the Discord and Slack adapters, and the admin console; Telegram is run under your own service definition. The CLI is an on-demand client; it does not start the daemon. The definitions it writes follow the host: launchd plists in `~/Library/LaunchAgents` on macOS, systemd user units in `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/systemd/user` on Linux. `--platform darwin|linux` with `--launch-agents-dir`/`--unit-dir` generates for the other host.

### The adapters restart with the gateway

A gateway restart does not kill an adapter. The adapter reconnects and keeps serving the previous generation: nothing dies, nothing is lost, `delivery.pending` stays 0, and the only symptom is replies arriving a beat late. The service definitions therefore bind the stack together instead of relying on an operator following a restart order.

On systemd each adapter and the admin unit carry `BindsTo=`, `After=`, and `PartOf=gajaeway-gateway.service`, so `systemctl --user restart gajaeway-gateway` realigns the whole stack in one command, and `WantedBy=gajaeway-gateway.service` means enabling the gateway enables them. Only the gateway unit carries `KillMode=process`, because GJC daemon and session hosts share its cgroup.

launchd has no `BindsTo`/`PartOf` equivalent, and `WatchPaths` does not restart an already-running job. Use the single entry point instead, on either host:

```sh
gajaeway ops restart-stack
```

On Linux that is the one `systemctl --user restart gajaeway-gateway`; on macOS it kickstarts the gateway and then every dependent job, in order. It never uses `launchctl bootout`, which removes the job and leaves it with no automatic recovery.

To diagnose a stack that is already mismatched, read `clients` in `gajaeway status`: every connected client reports its process `startedAt` and a `staleGeneration` flag that is true when the client process predates the running gateway process. That replaces comparing `ps -o lstart` by hand.

### One gateway per home, owned by the service manager

The gateway daemon is always started and stopped by launchd or systemd; never start a second copy by hand while a managed one runs. On boot the daemon settles ownership of `$GAJAEWAY_HOME` before touching its socket or database, using `$GAJAEWAY_HOME/daemon.pid`. This is gateway-home ownership, not ownership of the shared GJC broker:

- If the record names a live `gajaeway-gateway daemon` for the same home, the newcomer **waits** (up to 20s) for it to finish its ordered shutdown. It never signals that process - the service manager owns its lifecycle. If the predecessor is still alive at the deadline the newcomer exits 1 and the service manager retries under its own throttle.
- `daemon --only-new` skips the wait: any live same-home gateway is an immediate refusal (exit 1). Use it in scripts that must not disturb a running instance.
- A record whose process is dead, is not a gateway, or belongs to a different home is stale and is replaced.

Restart with the host's service manager: on the systemd deployment reached on SSH port 24, use `systemctl --user restart gajaeway-gateway`; on macOS launchd, use `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/dev.gajaeway.gateway`. These are alternatives, not consecutive steps. Give ordered shutdown at least 30 seconds with systemd `TimeoutStopSec` or launchd `ExitTimeOut`. Two gateways on one home can race over the database and delivery state even though neither owns the user broker.

### systemd: preserve shared GJC hosts across gateway restarts

Where the shared GJC daemon or SDK session hosts share the gateway's systemd cgroup, the gateway unit must use:

```ini
[Service]
KillMode=process
TimeoutStopSec=30s
```

`TimeoutStopSec` must be at least 30 seconds. `KillMode=process` limits service-manager termination to the gateway main process: SDK turns must outlive the gateway. `KillMode=control-group` and `KillMode=mixed` can kill the shared user daemon and session hosts during a restart, destroying in-flight turns even though session files remain durable. Do not restore cgroup-wide killing merely because an authority cutover completed; process-only termination remains required while those hosts share the gateway cgroup.

Normal gateway stop/start closes its own SDK calls and relays and reconnects as a client. It never kills the shared user broker, reaps old hosts, deletes discovery files, copies settings, or runs global session GC. A readiness failure is not permission to repair or replace the user's daemon. For a database changing broker authority, complete the explicit cutover in the runbook before starting recovery; changing service environment alone does not migrate old work.

The implemented administrative entry point requires the checkout and Bun. Stop the managed gateway and disable automatic restart throughout inspection and apply; keep the shared GJC daemon running. Use the verified absolute gateway home (`ABS`) and canonical absolute user agent directory (`CANONICAL`):

```sh
bun scripts/gjc-authority-cutover.ts inspect --home ABS --agent-dir CANONICAL
bun scripts/gjc-authority-cutover.ts apply --home ABS --agent-dir CANONICAL --expected-authority 'null' --quarantine --evidence 'operatorreference' --backup UNIQUEABS
```

Use `'null'` only when inspection reports `oldAuthority: null`; otherwise supply the exact inspected `oldAuthority` JSON as one shell-quoted argument. Supply an actual operator evidence reference and a unique, nonexistent absolute backup destination (`UNIQUEABS`) under an existing canonical parent. Both modes refuse a live gateway PID/socket. Apply holds the same kernel-backed home lease as gateway boot, revalidates authority, and creates an integrity-checked, non-overwriting backup before database migration. The runbook details the receipt and census to retain. Immutable old history stays quarantined without replay; old worker names remain reserved, so new work requires new names. Re-enable managed startup only after successful apply and executable/profile verification. Do not globally restore configuration, reap hosts, or delete sessions as part of cutover.

Deployment acceptance requires a newly gateway-created session to be visible through the normal user's SDK and the gateway with the exact same session ID. Record unrelated user session IDs and configuration fingerprints before deployment; verify they remain unchanged afterward. The current blocker is that SDK global model controls can modify user configuration: verify configuration invariance through session creation and model controls, not just executable/profile parity or a successful cutover. Do not mask a failure with automatic global configuration restore. Verify the existing user daemon survives a gateway restart and owned work remains observable without resend. These are required observations, not a claim that production is deployed or healthy.

## Troubleshooting

- **Socket missing:** verify the gateway service, configured socket path, parent permissions, and service log.
- **Every turn fails with an API error:** confirm `gjc` is on the service `PATH` and its model-key environment variables are present. If the log says a model was not found, use an explicit selector (`"model": "provider/model"`) or activate a gjc profile (`"model": { "preset": "profile-name" }`); profile default-role arrays retain gjc's native fallback-chain handling. A poisoned conversation session can be rebound with `/new`.
  Fast/priority processing is independent of the model selector: set `"serviceTier": "priority"` in gateway `config.json`. The gateway applies GJC `service_tier.set` once per persona session before its first prompt (OpenAI `service_tier=priority`; Anthropic fast speed where supported). Use `"model": { "preset": "gpt-heavy" }` to pin the model profile separately.
- **launchd hangs:** move the working directory, state, `gjc`, and symlink targets out of TCC-protected paths; then send `/new` to sessions created under the old location.
- **Webhook or monitor failure:** verify the gateway configuration and use `gajaeway monitors inspect <monitor-id>`.
- **Recovery or restore:** use the [operator runbook](runbooks/gajaeway-v1.md), especially its backup, restore, crash-recovery, and schema guidance.
