/**
 * Presence as a reaction gradient on the triggering message.
 *
 * Instead of posting and editing a "working…" message, the adapter reacts to
 * the message it is answering: a phase marker (⏳ queued, 🔧 tool, 💭 thinking,
 * ✍️ writing), a clock face that advances every minute, and an effort digit
 * for tool calls / tokens. Markers are swapped only when their bucket changes
 * and at most once per coalescing window, and every marker is removed when the
 * reply lands (or the turn goes stale). No chat.postMessage, no chat.update.
 *
 * Desired state and applied state are kept apart: `state` is what should be
 * visible, `shown` is what the API confirmed. A single reconcile loop per
 * message diffs the two and issues the adds/removes; anything that changes the
 * desired set while a reconcile is in flight is picked up by the loop's next
 * pass, so a slow Slack call can delay a swap but never lose it, and a failed
 * call leaves the marker un-shown so it is retried rather than believed.
 *
 * The same snapshot also drives Slack's native "<app> <status>" line
 * (assistant.threads.setStatus) under the thread the reply will land in - the
 * affordance users know from Slack's AI apps. It works on channel threads and
 * DMs with an ordinary bot token (verified live 2026-09-17), needs no Agent
 * registration, and is reconciled exactly like a marker: desired text vs
 * confirmed text. Slack clears it when the reply posts and expires it after
 * two minutes; retiring the entry clears it explicitly for silent turns.
