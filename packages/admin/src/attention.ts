/**
 * The "does anything need me?" projection.

 * The thresholds are deliberately hysteretic. A monitor event that was admitted
 * four seconds ago is not stuck, it is in flight; the gateway's own
 * reconciliation replays unfinished `admitted` / `dispatched` / `failed` events
 * (docs/monitors.md step 7), so the console only escalates once that repair path
 * has visibly failed to run.
