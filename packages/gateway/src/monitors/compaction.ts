/**
 * Monitor session safety net (issue #68).
 *
 * What this is NOT: the primary defence against an unbounded monitor session.
 * That is gjc's own native auto-compaction. Measured: the `-p --mode json`
 * non-interactive path goes through `AgentSession.prompt()` just like the
 * interactive one, so native auto-compaction already applies to monitor
 * authoring turns, and the GJC SDK additionally exposes a `compaction.run`
 * control action for an explicit request.
 *
 * What actually broke in production was therefore not "no compaction" but
 * "compaction fired too late": the session overflowed with 0 entries left and
 * the authoring turn came back empty, so dispatch settled as `internal_error`.
 * That host now runs gjc 0.15.5 with adaptive compaction (base 70%, floor 45%),
 * which restored the first line of defence.
 *
 * This module is the SECOND line: it detects the case where native compaction
 * silently fails again, and only then rolls the session as a last resort.
 * Invariants:
 * - A healthy monitor is NEVER rolled. Turn count is observational only.
 * - A roll requires consecutive context-class authoring failures AND a native
 *   compaction attempt that did not succeed.
 * - Nothing here calls an LLM: the digest is pure text assembly.

 *   This is what a compaction failure looks like from the outside, and it is

 * - `executor` — the work around the turn failed: a worker timeout (the aside
 *   collection worker's 300s cap is the canonical case), an external tool
 *   failure, a lock that made the run skip. The model may never have been
 *   asked. Misreading these as context exhaustion would roll healthy sessions
 *   every time an unrelated tool was slow.
 * - `protocol` — the answer arrived but broke the contract: unparseable JSON,
 *   wrong shape, missing/duplicate/unknown events. A non-empty answer proves
 *   the context still works, so this is the opposite of context evidence.
 *
 * Unrecognised runtime failures fall into `executor`: they are unexplained
 * machinery, not proof about context size, and the safety net must stay
