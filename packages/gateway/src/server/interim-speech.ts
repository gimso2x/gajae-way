/**
 * Mid-work speech gate (issue #71).
 *
 * A long agentic turn streams one assistant message per model step, and every
 * one of them used to ship to the channel. Live finding: a single turn arrived
 * as 5 chat messages within 90s (tool counter 6→12→18→26), and the fragments
 * were procedural narration — "채널이랑 직전 지시를 더 볼게요". That reads as a
 * work log, not as a person chatting.
 *
 * The fix is NOT silence: a persona that says nothing for three minutes and
 * then drops a wall of text is just as inhuman. Mid-work speech stays, but it
 * must be what a person actually says in chat: something they found, a short
 * reaction, a heads-up that this will take a while, or a question that unblocks
 * them.
 *
 * DESIGN INTENT: the base system prompt is the PRIMARY mechanism (see
 * GENERIC_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT). This module is the BACKSTOP — a model that
 * ignores the instruction must not be able to flood the room. Therefore the
 * rules here are deliberately few and conservative: they suppress only what is
 * unmistakably process narration and default to delivering anything else.
 * Tightening this into an exhaustive regex zoo would start eating real replies,
 * which is the worse failure: a suppressed finding is invisible forever, while
 * a leaked narration line is merely noise.

 *    뒤지다) combined with an intent or in-progress ending (~ㄹ게요, ~겠습니다,
 *    ~려고요, ~중, ~고 있어요). "채널이랑 직전 지시를 더 볼게요" and
 *    "로그부터 보겠습니다" match; "로그에 500이 3분마다 찍혀요" does not, because
 *    it has no inspection verb — it is a finding.
 *  - English: the same shape — an intent marker (let me / I'll / going to /
 *    next / first) or a progressive form in front of an inspection verb
 *    (check / look / read / inspect / review / scan / search / query / grep /
 *    open / examine / dig into / pull up).
 *
 * Anything reporting a RESULT survives, even when it names a file or the DB,
 * because the verb is what distinguishes "I will look at the logs" from "the
 * logs say X".
