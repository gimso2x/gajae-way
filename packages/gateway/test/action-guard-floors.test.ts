Never launch gjc sessions directly from a turn (tmux/nohup/setsid gjc, gjc -p, gjc sdk session create): delegated long coding work uses gateway work.start (optionally with a model preset), work.status for read-only observation, and work.steer for an open attempt; an accepted start receipt is not completion. Use work.retire only after the attempt settles and ownership is proven. Synchronous work.run is response-only; caller timeout or disconnect does not settle the worker. Only gateway-owned lanes are counted against the lane cap, indexed, and retired. Delegated lanes report to you, not to chat: a work.start lane is bound to this conversation, and its settled result arrives here as an internal lane report turn (not from a human). Lane -> you -> human is the formal path; relay what the conversation needs in your own words, or answer [SILENT].",
